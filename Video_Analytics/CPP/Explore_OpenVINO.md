## Explore Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit Samples
### Introduction
The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit for quickly developing applications and Solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the Toolkit extends computer vision workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance.
### The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit:
- Enables the CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge.
- Supports heterogeneous execution across Intel® computer vision accelerators, using a common API for the CPU, Intel® HD Graphics, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick, and Intel® FPGA. However, we are not covering Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick and Intel® FPGA in this lab.
- Speeds time-to-market through an easy-to-use library of computer vision functions and pre-optimized kernels.
- Includes optimized calls for computer vision standards, including OpenCV, OpenCL™, and OpenVX™

### Running the Sample Programs
* **Security Barrier Camera Sample**                            
**Description**                           
Showcase Vehicle Detection, followed by Vehicle Attributes and License Plate Recognition are applied on top of Vehicle Detection. The vehicle attributes execution barrier reports the general vehicle attributes, like the vehicle type and colour, whether the type is something like car, van, or bus.
The application reads command line parameters and loads the specified models. The Vehicle/License-Plate Detection model is required, and the others are optional.

* **Set Environment variables using below commands**
```
cd C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\bin
setupvars.bat
```

* **Build and Run Sample with CPU**
- Go to C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\deployment_tools\demo

- run demo_security_barrier_camera.bat

- **Output and Performance**
The output uses OpenCV to display the resulting frame with detections rendered as bounding boxes and text with vehicle attributes, license plate, detection time and frames per second (fps). The inference was done using a pre-trained model on **CPU**.


- **Manually Build Example**

- Navigate to: C:\Users\Intel\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\inference_engine_samples_2017
- Open the samples.sln file and build the security_barrier_camera_demo.cpp sample.

Upon successful build, a security_barrier_camera_demo.exe file is available inside the intel64\Debug folder.

Running the application with –h option results with the following information:

For this document, we are not using all parameters. Participants are expected to explore multiple options.

- **Case 1:** To run the sample application on **CPU**, execute the following commands:

```
C:\Users\Intel\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\inference_engine_samples_2017\intel64\Debug\security_barrier_camera_demo.exe  -i  C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\deployment_tools\demo\car_1.bmp -m C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\deployment_tools\intel_models\vehicle-license-plate-detection-barrier-0106\FP32\vehicle-license-plate-detection-barrier-0106.xml -m_va C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\deployment_tools\intel_models\vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039\FP32\vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039.xml -d CPU

```


Next, we repeat the exercise with **GPU** and observe the performance.

- **case2:** To run the sample application on **GPU**, execute the following commands;

```
C:\Users\Intel\Documents\Intel\OpenVINO\inference_engine_samples_2017\intel64\Debug\security_barrier_camera_demo.exe  -i  C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\deployment_tools\demo\car_1.bmp -m C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\deployment_tools\intel_models\vehicle-license-plate-detection-barrier-0106\FP32\vehicle-license-plate-detection-barrier-0106.xml -m_va C:\Intel\computer_vision_sdk\deployment_tools\intel_models\vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039\FP32\vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039.xml -d GPU

```
- **Output and Performance**
The output uses OpenCV to display the resulting frame with detections rendered as bounding boxes and text with vehicle attributes, license plate, detection time and fps. Compared to CPU acceleration, GPU acceleration is better in terms of detection time and fps.
