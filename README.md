- 2x M.2 22x42/80 (key M) slots for SATA3 or PCIe* X4 Gen3 NVMe or AHCI SSDs
SDXC slot with UHS-I support
- 19V, 120W  AC-DC power adapter
- Install your own memory, storage, and operating system (not included)
- Full range of Intel® processors
- NUC support Intel® vPro™ technology, and pre-installed Unite HUB-side software. Business members simply just need to install Unite clients on their own devices for easy and fast connections to meetings.

**2. OPS device**                                                 
Intel® launched the Open Pluggable Specification (OPS) to standardize the system architecture between displays and media players. OPS allows for more cost-effective design, deployment, and management of digital signage and other display solutions that support advanced functionality and emerging use cases, including interactivity and anonymous audience analytics.

As OPS has quickly become a standard for creating integrated display solutions, Intel® is providing the industry with OPS+, offering future-proofed capabilities targeted at higher resolution content and additional use cases.
