# Intel® Retail Workshop Setup Guide
Welcome to the Intel® Retail Workshop. In this workshop, we explore the OpenVINO™ toolkit through lectures and hands-on labs. By the end of the workshop, you should have an understanding of the OpenVINO™ toolkit and some strategies for how to implement the toolkit in your video analytics applications.
## How to Use the Lab Material
The links below guide workshop attendees through slides and labs in the Visual Retail Workshop using the OpenVINO™ toolkit.

## Hardware Used in this Workshop
Intel offers scalable hardware solutions at different power, performance and price points. During these labs we will be using an Intel® NUC (code named Dawson Canyon) and an Open Pluggable Specification (OPS) device.

### Intel® NUC                    
The Intel® NUC is a mini PC with entertainment, gaming, and productivity features, including a customizable board that is able to accept various memory, storage, and operating system requirements.

#### Intel® NUC Key Features
- Intel® Iris® Pro graphics (580)
- 2x M.2 22x42/80 (key M) slots for SATA3 or PCIe\* X4 Gen3 NVMe\* or AHCI SSDs
SDXC slot with UHS-I support
- 19V, 120W  AC-DC power adapter
- Install your own memory, storage, and operating system (not included)
- Full range of Intel® Architecture Processors
- Intel® NUC supports Intel® vPro™ technology, and pre-installed Intel Unite® software. Business members simply just need to install the Intel Unite® client on their own device for an easy and fast connection to meetings.

### Open Pluggable Specification (OPS)                                               
Intel launched OPS to standardize the system architecture between displays and media players. OPS allows for more cost-effective design, deployment, and management of digital signage and other display solutions that support advanced functionality and emerging use cases, including interactivity and anonymous audience analytics.

As OPS has quickly become a standard for creating integrated display solutions, Intel is providing the industry with OPS+, offering future-proofed capabilities targeted at higher resolution content and additional use cases.

#### OPS Key Features
- 180 mm x 119 mm x 30 mm, fully enclosed.
- Enhanced thermal design supports broader range of Intel® Architecture Processors.
- Enables new and customizable functionality through an additional connector interface that can be enhanced further with Intel® FPGAs.
- Optimized for interactive white boards, commercial digital signage, kiosks, visual data devices, video walls, and more.
- Ability to customize a protocol and simultaneously support advanced use cases including real-time analytics and video capture performed on the display itself.
- Features a second high-speed connector and is backward compatible with previous OPS specifications.
- OPS supports Intel® vPro™ technology, and pre-installed Intel Unite® software. Business members simply just need to install the Intel Unite® client on their own device for an easy and fast connection to meetings.
